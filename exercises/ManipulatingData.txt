# Manipulating Data

Let's begin our EDA on our full wine data set by investigating our data and creating some new variables.  

1. Filter the data to only look at high-quality wines (`quality` > 6.5) and wines that have a reasonable alcohol value (`alcohol` < 132).  (`filter()`)
```{r}

```
2. Use chaining to now sort the data from highest `quality` to lowest. (`arrange()`)
```{r}

```
3. Use chaining to select only the variables that contain `acid`, the `alcohol` variable, the `type` variable, and the `quality` variable. (`select()` with `contains()`)
```{r}

```
4. Use chaining to add the mean and standard deviation of the `alcohol` variable to the data set for each setting of the `quality` variable.  (`group_by()`, `mutate()`)
```{r}

```
