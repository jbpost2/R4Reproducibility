# Introduction & Purpose

This document serves to provide some basic information about the `tidyverse` followed by an example Exploratory Data Analysis.

The `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

Install the complete tidyverse with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


# `tidyverse` Core Packages {.tabset} 

The four *core* packages that we'll use the most are given below along with their purpose and a quick example of some functionality.

## dplyr

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jbpost2/R4Reproducibility/raw/main/exercises/img/dplyr.png")
```  

[`dplyr` is a grammar of data manipulation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”. You can learn more about them by typing `vignette("dplyr")` into the console after reading the `dplyr` package in via `library(dplyr)`. As well as these single-table verbs, `dplyr` also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in `vignette("two-table")`.

If you are new to `dplyr`, the best place to start is the data transformation chapter in [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

```{r}
library(dplyr)

starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")
```

## ggplot2  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jbpost2/R4Reproducibility/raw/main/exercises/img/ggplot2.png")
```  

[`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). You provide the data, tell `ggplot2` how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

```{r, out.width = "75%"}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## readr

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jbpost2/R4Reproducibility/raw/main/exercises/img/readr.png")
```  

[The goal of `readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. If you are new to `readr`, the best place to start is the data import chapter in [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

## tidyr  

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jbpost2/R4Reproducibility/raw/main/exercises/img/tidyr.png")
```  

[The goal of `tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

1. Every column is variable.
2. Every row is an observation.
3. Every cell is a single value.

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. If you ensure that your data is tidy, you’ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in `vignette("tidy-data")`.

```{r}
library(tidyr)

relig_income

relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "frequency")
```


# Data Structures in `R`

The two most important data structures in `R` are the (atomic) vector and data frame.  Let's do some practice with those.

## Vectors

1. We often need to get every combination of a vector or vectors to use when fitting models. For instance if I had three vectors 
- `a` (with elements `10` and `12`)
- `b` (with elements `1` and `3`)
- `c` ( with elements `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`)
we often need to create a data frame that looks like the following:  

|Var1 | Var2 | Var 3 |
|----:|-----:|------:|
|10   | 1    | c1    |
|12   | 1    | c1    |
|10   | 3    | c1    |
|12   | 3    | c1    |
|10   | 1    | c2    |
|12   | 1    | c2    |
|10   | 3    | c2    |
|12   | 3    | c2    |
|10   | 1    | c3    |
|12   | 1    | c3    |
|10   | 3    | c3    |
|12   | 3    | c3    |

<ul>
a. Create a (numeric) vector with values 10 and 12.  Save this as an R object, `a`.  Repeat to create `b`. 
    ```{r}
    a <- c(10, 12)
    b <- c(1, 3)
    ```
b. Create a (character) vector with values 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3'. Save this as an R object, `c`.
    ```{r}
    c <- c("c1", "c2", "c3")
    ```
c. Use the `expand.grid()` function to create the data frame above.  See the examples at the bottom of the help page (`help("expand.grid")`)
    ```{r}
    expand.grid(a, b, c)
    ```
    
</ul>

2. Another common task is to combine character strings together.  This can be done with the `paste()` function.
    a. Create a character vector (call it `adj`) of length 4 consisting of adjectives (answers will vary).
        ```{r}
    adj <- c("red", "beautiful", "old", "new")
        ```
    b. Create a second character vector of same length consisting of nouns (call it `nouns`).
        ```{r}
    nouns <- c("phone", "car", "house", "pizza")
        ```
    c. Use the `paste()` function to combine these vectors elementwise.  Play around with the `sep = ` argument.
        ```{r}
    paste(adj, nouns)
    paste(adj, nouns, sep = "_")
        ```

## Data Frames

R has some built in data frames that we can use.  Run `ToothGrowth` (note the case) in your console to see a data set about tooth growth for Guinea Pigs based off of differing amounts of Vitamin C (VC vs OJ).  

1. Determine the internal structure of the `ToothGrowth` object using the `str()` function
    ```{r}
    str(ToothGrowth)
    ```
2. Have R return just the dose column using two different methods.
    ```{r}
    ToothGrowth[, 3]
    ToothGrowth$dose
    dplyr::select(ToothGrowth, dose) #covered later
    ```


# Reading Data

The data set we'll use for our EDA comes from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).  There are two data sets that are 'related to red and white variants of the Prtuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.'  There are physicochemical variables and a quality score, as rated by experts.  

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
- quality (score between 0 and 10)


## Reading in the White Wine Data

There is an excel version of the white wine data set available at <https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/white-wine.xlsx>.  

- Download this file
- Place it in a folder you know (such as your working directory, `getwd()`)
- Import the data from the first sheet using `readxL::read_excel()`

```{r}
library(readxl)
white <- read_excel("../slides/data/white-wine.xlsx")
white
```

When you print the data set out to the console, you may notice that some of the variable names are surrounded by backticks.  This is because they are non-standard (they include a space in them).  We can rename them in a number of ways.  We'll do it by reading in the variable names from the 2nd sheet of the same file.

- Read in the data from the 2nd sheet.  This should return a data frame with one column containing alternative versions of the variable names.
- Grab that column (say with `$`) and overwrite the `colnames()` of your current `tibble`.  For example,
`colnames(my_wine) <- names_df$Variables`

```{r}
names_df <- read_excel("../slides/data/white-wine.xlsx", sheet = 2)
names_df
colnames(white) <- names_df$Variables
```

Lastly, we'll add a column to this data set to indicate the wines are white.  Run the code below (with necessary modifications on the `tibble` object name).

`my_wine <- mutate(my_wine, type = "white")`

```{r}
white <- mutate(white, type = "white")
white
```


## Reading in the Red Wine Data

There is a semi-colon delimited version of the red wine data set available at <https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/red-wine.csv>.  This can be read in directly from the URL using the `readr::read_delim()` function with the `delim = ";"` argument (`read_csv2()` would work here too but it reads in some columns as character instead of double).  

- You should replace the variables as done above
- You should append a column denoting the `type` as "red"

```{r}
library(readr)
red <- read_delim("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/red-wine.csv", delim = ";")
colnames(red) <- names_df$Variables
red <- mutate(red, type = "red")
red
```


## Combining the Two Wine Data Sets

Our final task is to combine these two data sets into one data set.  They both have the exact same columns so this is an easy append task!  

Use the `dplyr::bind_rows()` function (see the help) to create one `tibble` containing all of the wine data.  

```{r}
wine <- bind_rows(white, red)
wine
```

# Manipulating Data

Let's begin our EDA on our full wine data set by investigating our data and creating some new variables.  

1. Filter the data to only look at high-quality wines (`quality` > 6.5) and wines that have a reasonable alcohol value (`alcohol` < 132).  (`filter()`)
2. Use chaining to now sort the data from highest `quality` to lowest. (`arrange()`)
3. Use chaining to select only the variables that contain `acid`, the `alcohol` variable, the `type` variable, and the `quality` variable. (`select()` with `contains()`)
4. Use chaining to add the mean and standard deviation of the `alcohol` variable to the data set for each setting of the `quality` variable.  (`group_by()`, `mutate()`)

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(quality > 6.5 & alcohol < 132) %>%
  arrange(desc(quality)) %>%
  select(contains("acid"), alcohol, type, quality) %>%
  group_by(quality) %>%
  mutate(mean_alcohol = mean(alcohol), sd_alcohol = sd(alcohol))
```
